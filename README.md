# NUSustainability
Team project of **BT3103 - Application Systems Development for Business Analytics, AY20/21 Semester 2** 

## Application Description
NUSustainability, the centralized platform, is an all-in-one solution for NUS students to access the environmental initiatives that are organised around NUS. It aims to bridge the information gap between event organisers and NUS students who may be interested in attending these events, but are unaware of them. Regular updates to events and items available will be provided by the application and users will also be able to see events by location.
## User Group
- NUS students
- NUS Waste management & Recycling TaskForce (WART)
